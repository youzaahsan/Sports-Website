        <p><h5>Cricket Rules and Regulations</h5>
    
            <h5>General Overview</h5>
            <p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each. The game is played on an oval field with a rectangular pitch in the center. The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team while following the established rules of the game.</p>
            
            <h5>Basic Rules</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batting:</strong><p> One team bats while the other bowls and fields. The batting team tries to score as many runs as possible. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Bowling:</strong><p> The bowling team aims to dismiss the batsmen by hitting the stumps or catching them out. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Overs:</strong><p> An over consists of six legitimate deliveries from the bowler. In limited overs formats, there are a set number of overs per innings. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Runs:</strong><p>Runs are scored when the batsman hits the ball and runs between two wickets. A boundary (hitting the ball out of the playing field) scores 4 runs, while a six (hitting the ball over the boundary on the full) scores 6 runs. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Wickets:</strong><p> A batsman is out when they are bowled, caught, run out, stumped, or given out by the umpire for other reasons. </p></li>
            </ul></p>
        <img src="../images/cricket10.webp" alt="">
        <h5>Types of Dismissals</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bowled:</strong><p> The ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails.</li>
        <li><strong>Caught:</strong><p> The batsman hits the ball, and it is caught by a fielder before it hits the ground. </p></li>
        <li><strong>Run Out:</strong><p>A batsman is run out if the wicketkeeper or a fielder hits the stumps with the ball before the batsman reaches the crease. </p></li>
        <li><strong>Stumped:</strong> <p> The wicketkeeper removes the bails while the batsman is out of their crease. </p></li>
        <li><strong>Leg Before Wicket (LBW):</strong> <p>The ball hits the batsman's leg in line with the stumps and would have hit the stumps had the leg not been in the way. </p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Formats of Cricket</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Test Cricket:</strong> <p> Played over 5 days with each team having two innings. The match can end in a win, loss, or draw. </p></li>

            <h5>Umpires and Decision Making</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Umpires:</strong><p> Two on-field umpires oversee the match, ensuring players adhere to the rules and making decisions about dismissals, runs, and other plays.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Third Umpire:</strong> <p>For certain situations (e.g., run-outs, close catches), a third umpire reviews video footage to make decisions. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Decision Review System (DRS):</strong> <p>Teams can challenge an umpire's decision using technology like ball tracking and Hawk-Eye to make more accurate rulings. </p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Common Violations</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No-Ball:</strong> <p>When the bowler oversteps the crease or bowls an illegal delivery. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Wide:</strong><p> When the bowler delivers the ball too far from the batsman for them to play a shot. </p></li>
                <li><strong>Overstepping:</strong> <p>The bowler must not step over the line when delivering the ball. Overstepping can result in a no-ball. </p></li>
            </ul>
        
        
          
          
        
          
       
        
        
       <h2> Equipment <br></h2>
        
       <p>Cricket requires specific equipment for safe and effective gameplay. Key items include a **bat**, used by batsmen to hit the ball, and a **ball**, made of leather with a hard core. **Protective gear** like pads, gloves, and helmets ensures player safety, especially against fast deliveries. Additionally, **stumps and bails** are used to form the wickets, essential for gameplay and dismissals.</p>
