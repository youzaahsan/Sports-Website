    <h2> History<br></h2>
       
</p> 
<img src="../images/sh2.webp" alt="">
<p>Shooting sports have a long history, dating back to the 14th century when archery was used both for sport and military purposes. The first recorded shooting competitions emerged in Europe, with rifle shooting gaining popularity in the 19th century. The advent of modern firearms in the 1800s led to the development of pistol and rifle shooting as organized sports. The first Olympic shooting competition was held in 1896, featuring rifle and pistol events. Over time, shooting sports expanded to include disciplines like shotgun shooting, with events like trap and skeet introduced in the 20th century. Archery also became a part of the Olympics in 1900. Technological advancements in firearms and equipment have continuously shaped the sport. Today, shooting sports are a major part of international competitions, including the Olympic Games and World Championships. The rise of precision sports and improvements in training techniques have made shooting more accessible and competitive worldwide.<br></p>
    <p>Shooting sports continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, with both men and women participating in various disciplines. The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) was established in 1907 to standardize rules and regulations for shooting events across the globe. The introduction of air rifles and pistols in the 1980s added new dimensions to the sport, allowing for greater accessibility and less reliance on ammunition. In recent decades, shooting sports have grown in popularity, with countries worldwide developing elite training programs. Innovations in target systems, such as electronic scoring, have enhanced the precision and fairness of competitions. Today, shooting sports include disciplines like biathlon, practical shooting, and IPSC, with athletes competing at both national and international levels, culminating in prestigious events such as the Olympic Games.</p>
